          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In today's fast-paced digital world, optimizing the workspace has become essential for
            enhancing productivity. Modern workplaces are evolving to integrate technology,
            ergonomic designs, and flexible environments that cater to different work styles. This
